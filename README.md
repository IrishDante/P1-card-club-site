This site is designed to help people interested in Card Games in Dublin find a club where they can meet other interested people specifically in Dublin Ireland.
The site is built to provide access to a mailing list and to also feature content from local players to help motivate new and interested users.

# Testing

Throughout development of the site I consistently checked to make sure that code was functioning as intended.
The site has been tested on chrome, and edge for Windows 10, as well as multiple browsers on Android (Facebook inapp, Chrome).

Errors in the CSS existed early into the project but were removed as my familiarity with the language improved.
