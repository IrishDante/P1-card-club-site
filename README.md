# Testing

Throughout development of the site I consistently checked to make sure that code was functioning as intended.
The site has been tested on chrome, and edge for Windows 10, as well as multiple browsers on Android (Facebook inapp, Chrome).

Errors in the CSS existed early into the project but were removed as my familiarity with the language improved.
